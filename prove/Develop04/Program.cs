//People often try to memorize poems or passages of scripture. One of the challenges they encounter is that they want to hide the scripture while they are practicing, but they may not be able to recite the whole scripture from memory just yet.

To help solve this problem so that people can better memorize a scripture, write a program that displays the full scripture and then hides a few words at a time until the complete scripture is hidden.
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello Develop04 World!");
    }
}
